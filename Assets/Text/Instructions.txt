I'm so glad to see you!
I was starting to get worried, you were taking so long.
...
Lately,
it's felt really gray and lonely without you home.
...
Can you tell me a story?
Can you tell me about the adventures you've been on?
Can you tell me about the world outside?
What are people saying?
What are they doing?
...
This place could use a little color. How about it?
