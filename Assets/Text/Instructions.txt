I'm so glad to see you!
I was starting to get worried, you were taking so long.
...
Lately,
it's felt really gray and lonely without you home.
...
Tell me what sorts of things you've seen.
Or the rumors you've heard.
Or the adventures you've been on!
...
Anything that'll keep you home a little longer.
