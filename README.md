# Deer Twitter,

## What is Deer Twitter?
'Deer Twitter,' is my capstone project for Ada Developers Academy, displaying the culmination of the skills and tools learned in 6 months of programming education.
In this game, you play as a character collecting randomized tweets in a Mad Libs style story.
The concept behind this little game is a demonstration of how technology can be used as an emotional and personal art experience.

## How do I play it?
You can download the zip file to play on your own desktop (currently MacOS X and Windows) at http://www.superprincessparty.com

## How can I make changes, or check out your code?
You will need to install the Unity3D Engine software. This project was made using Unity3D 2017.2Of3. Get a free version of Unity at their website. https://store.unity.com/

You will also need to set up Git Large File Storage (LFS) in order to pull/push the bigger files created by Unity. To set it up, download and install the Git LFS command line extension as documented on the Git LFS site. https://git-lfs.github.com/

For more information on using Git with Unity, check out this awesome step-by-step tutorial. https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-git-with-unity

To play around with the Twitter API, you will need to get your own Twitter Key and Secret. Get set up at https://apps.twitter.com/

## Known bugs and issues
This project does NOT run when embedded in a web page with Twitter enabled. I'm not sure why, but PLEASE make a pull request if you figure it out before I do! **I suspect the Twitter information is not secure enough, so enter your Key and Secret at your own risk.** The Twitter tools I used were created by Craig Tinney at https://gibletsofjesus.itch.io/unity-twitter-tools

## Planned future enhancements
More secure Twitter tools
Players can add Twitter accounts of their choosing
Multiple Twitter accounts to pull randomized tweets from
More depth to environments (animals, fixed images, more consistent styling)
